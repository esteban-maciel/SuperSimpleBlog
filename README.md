# Super Simple Blog

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Does exactly what you'd expect! Create an account, post a blog, delete something you shouldn't have said on the internet, and see what you're friends are up to -- it's like Twitter for your parents!

Use in conjunction with [this Express server project](https://github.com/esteban-maciel/SuperSimpleBlog-API).

## Using this project

1. Make sure you have Node.js install. You can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Clone the project, change into the directory, and install the dependencies.

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/esteban-maciel/comp584-finalproject
cd comp584-finalproject
npm install
```

3. Make sure your server is running and listening on port 8080.

4. Register your account and log in. 
5. The home screen will display all blogs available in the database and you can click on them to read the entire blog.
6. You can create a blog with the 'Create' button in the navbar.
7. You can delete your blogs, but not anybody else's.
8. Feel free to poke around the code for an example of how to do some simple things in React.js!
